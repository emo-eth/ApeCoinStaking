# ApeCoinStaking

**This is not the official ApeCoinStaking Repository**


The ApeCoinStaking repository was not public at immediate launch, so I pulled the source from the [Etherscan link](https://etherscan.io/address/0x5954aB967Bc958940b7EB73ee84797Dc8a2AFbb9) tweeted by the authors, [Horizen Labs](https://horizenlabs.io/), and set it up as a Foundry project ***with some modifications to aid development.***

The [official contract repository](https://github.com/HorizenLabs/ape-staking-public), configured for HardHat, is available on the Horizen Labs GitHub account.


## Included Contracts
### ApeCoinStaking
This is the main contract that handles staking and rewards.

### ApeCoinStakedVoting
This contract allows users to vote on proposals using their staked ApeCoin.
## Changes

- The deploy script included in the original Horizen Labs repository has been ported as a Foundry Script (`script/DeployContracts.s.sol`)
- Changed schema from `pragma solidity 0.8.10;` to `pragma solidity ^0.8.10;` to facilitate building extensions in forks of this repository with newer versions of Solidity
  - To more closely match the deployed contract, you may change the `solc` config in `foundry.toml` to `0.8.10`
- Structs have been pulled into their own file (`lib/ApeCoinStakingStructs.sol`) as top-level members for ease of import into other files
- Errors have been pulled into their own file (`lib/ApeCoinStakingErrors.sol`) as top-level members for ease of import into  other files
- Events have been pulled into a separate interface (`lib/ApeCoinStakingEvents.sol`) for ease of inheritance by test contracts
- Formatted with `forge fmt` with custom settings in `foundry.toml`

## Testing

The included `BaseTest.sol` is meant as a base for writing Foundry tests. It configures a fork of Ethereum Mainnet at block `16119274`, after the staking contract `TimeRange`s were configured and ownership transferred, but before any stakes had been deposited. It includes internal variables that point to all relevant mainnet smart contracts as well as helper functions to grant ApeCoin or BAYC/MAYC/BAKC tokens to specified accounts.

The included `ApeCoinStaking.t.sol` inherits from `BaseTest.sol`, grants the test contract some ApeCoin and relevant NFTs, and ensures it can call the main deposit methods on the ApeCoinStaking contract as deployed on Mainnet.
